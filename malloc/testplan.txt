/* Test Plan
 * Joshua Silva
 * ECE 2230 
 * Spring 2024
 * MP4
 *
 *
 * Purpose: Walk through test cases, and what they are testing, to prove program functionality.
 * 
 * Assumptions: That all functions in mem.c are working properly. Will use default search location & policy unless 
 * stated otherwise. Default is HEAD_FIRST and FIRST_FIT
 *
 */ 

Notes: 
*Look at testlog.txt for outputs 
*Look at Perform_Eval.pdf for detailed conversation about Performance & results of Unit Driver 4

*Unit Driver 0: 
	*Will prove that user can do a simple allocation of 16 bytes and free it as well

	*Expected to see a successful malloc and free that returns everything back to the heap

*Unit Driver 1: 
 	*Will prove that user can do allocate various parts of a page, to reveal an empty free list, then allocate one more time 
	and free all allocations

	*Expected to see an empty page when prompted, and all frees lead to no leaks possible in the heap

*Unit Driver 2: 
 	*Will test allocating a whole page, and a page minus one chunk

	*Expected to see empty free list for both allocations due to memory still needing a header chunk

*Unit Driver 3: 
	*Will prove that user can request more than one page

	*Expected to see matching free blocks to amount of allocations requested. And pages requested to match total bytes

*Unit Driver 4: 
	*Will prove that user can randomly allocate and free memory, with heap still working. Will use this to 
	conduct performance evaluation and test search location/policy 
	*See Performance Evaluation PDF for more detailed conversation about testing

	*Expected to see full functionality of heap, with memory being allocated depending on search location & policy 
	and all memory will return to heap with no leaks
